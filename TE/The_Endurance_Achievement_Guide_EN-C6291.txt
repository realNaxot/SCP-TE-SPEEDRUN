SCP - THE ENDURANCE ACHIEVEMENT GUIDE:

Bronze:
- Seriously? How?:
-- Turn off the ventilation on Night 1 and suffocate to death.

Silver:
- Ah, there you are!:
-- Let SCP-1048 into the office and press his nose repeatedly.

- OwO What's this?:
-- Enter the "commands" or "help" command into the main terminal. 

- The abyss cannot hold me:
-- Escape SCP-106's Pocket Dimension and successfully finish the night.

- One step forward, two steps back:
-- Find a Burnt Note in SCP-106's Pocket Dimension and fall into the abyss.

- You're cute, but that could've killed me:
-- Let SCP-1048 into the office and let him sit on the PC while it is turned OFF for at least 1 hour (1 minute of real time), then successfully finish the night.

- So close, yet so far:
-- Die within the final 10 minutes (10 seconds of real time) of the night.

- Staring contest:
-- Keep SCP-173 inside the office for at least 1 hour (1 minute of real time).

- It doesn't have to end this way:
-- Beat Night 5.

- Catch me if you can:
-- Beat the night after enraging SCP-096 (Find him on the cameras and stare at him seconds before the night ends).

Gold:
- You enjoy it a little too much, don't you?:
-- Die in every way possible. (i.e. from: SCP-049, SCP-096, SCP-106, SCP-173, SCP-860-2, suffocation, fall damage in the Pocket Dimension and the abyss of the Pocket Dimension).

- Oh yeah, it's all coming together:
-- Use the secret code from the Burnt Notes found in the Pocket Dimension.

- L + Ratio:
-- Win Night 3 using no cameras.

- You've got a friend in me:
-- Accumulate more than 1000 points of AI added by SCP-066.

- Hold up. Is that a bug or a feature?:
-- Manage to close the jammed door on SCP-860-2 by pressing the button repeatedly while it is blocked by SCP-860-2.

- The Bigger Picture:
-- Successfully finish Night 6 without achieving the True Ending.

- All it takes is one slip...:
-- Achieve the True Ending by turning ON the necessary Lifts on floors C, B and A through the Power Manager mode in Night 6 and escaping the facility by clicking on the corridor in front of you.

Platinum:
- Lore Hunter:
-- Unlock all endings.

- My goals are beyond your understanding:
-- Turn off every light through the Power Manager mode in Night 6 (remember that you have to turn off the light within the office last, as turning it off will shut down the PC and consequently - the Power Manager).

- That's all you've got?:
-- Successfully finish the 8/20 mode.
